# This code uses variables in place of numbers in the calculation.  Add comments to explain how it works.

num1 = 20
num2 = 5
# num1 and num2 variables take integers

result = num1 * num2
# the new variable result multplies num1 num2 variables, so the the result becomes num1 * num2 

print(result)

# This code uses input to assign data into a variable.  Add comments to explain how it works.
print("Enter a number")
# a user inputs number
num1 = int(input())
# num1 variables takes input, and by using int function, it translates from string to integer, so it can make math. operations with other numbers
num2 = 2

result = num1 // num2
# result variable divides num1 by num2 and after rounds it

print(result)
